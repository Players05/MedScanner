# 🏥 MedScanner - AI-Powered Medical Document Analysis Platform

> **This is a hackathon project which was made in the Prarambh Hackathon**

## 🌟 **What is MedScanner?**

MedScanner is an AI-powered web application that analyzes medical prescriptions and reports to help people understand their medications and medical conditions without waiting in long queues at hospitals or clinics.

## 🚨 **Why We Made This Project?**

In hospitals and medical facilities, there are often long queues of people waiting to get their prescriptions and medical reports checked by doctors. During rush hours, many people waste valuable time standing in line just to understand:

- What medications they've been prescribed
- What their medical reports indicate
- What diseases they might have
- What stage their disease is in

**MedScanner solves this problem by allowing people to:**
- Upload their prescriptions and get instant information about medications
- Learn about generic medicine alternatives available
- Understand what diseases the medications treat
- Upload medical reports to know their disease and its stage
- Save time by avoiding long queues
